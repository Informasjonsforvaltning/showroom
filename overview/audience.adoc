== Audience [[audience]]


The showrooms are primarily meant for you who have certain knowledge of RDF, and when you are e.g. 

* implementing one or more of the RDF-based Norwegian national specifications demonstrated in the showrooms,  
* looking for some RDF-examples of the usage of the specifications, 
* looking for some "building blocks" (instances in RDF) to test your implementation of the specifications,
* or simply wondering how resource descriptions in accordance with the specifications may look like in RDF. 

The showrooms are also meant for you who are our international colleague and who want to learn more about our national RDF-based specifications for data sharing and reuse.
