== Audience [[audience]]


The showrooms are meant for you who have certain knowledge of RDF, and when you are e.g. 

* implementing one or more of the RDF-based Norwegian national specifications demonstrated in the showrooms,  
* looking for some RDF-examples of the usage of the specifications, 
* looking for some "building blocks" (instances in RDF) to test your implementation of the specifications,
* or simply wondering how resource descriptions in accordance with the specifications may look like in RDF.
