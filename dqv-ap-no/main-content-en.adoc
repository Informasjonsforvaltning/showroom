== Purpose [[purpose]] 

This showroom is meant to 

* demonstrate how to use DQV-AP-NO to describe dataset quality;
* demonstrate some cross-references between dataset quality descriptions and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provide reusable, machine-readable dataset quality descriptions, for testing and demonstration purposes.

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo dataset descriptions are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to DCAT-AP-NO._ 

== Demo resources in this showroom [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoDataset1[demo dataset] with a set of quality measurements and quality annotations. 

#_explanations will come_#
 
== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

*_Note_*: _Not all possible cross-references are demonstrated in this showroom. The lists are thus not exhaustive._
