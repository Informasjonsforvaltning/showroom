== Purpose [[purpose]] 

This showroom is meant to 

* demonstrate how to use DQV-AP-NO to describe dataset quality;
* demonstrate some cross-references between dataset quality descriptions and other resources demonstrated in some of the other showrooms;
* provide reusable, machine-readable dataset quality descriptions, for testing and demonstration purposes.

*_Disclaimer_*: _The machine-readable demo dataset descriptions are meant for demo purposes only. They do not represent any real world phenomena at all. On the other hand, they are supposed to syntactically conform to DCAT-AP-NO._ 

== Demo resources in this showroom [[demo-resources]]

In this showroom we have a https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoDataset1[demo dataset] with a set of quality measurements and quality annotations:

* It has two quality annotations: 
** one referring to <https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/dqvno#isAuthoritative[]> which is a predefined instance of dqv:QualityCertificate indicting that the dataset is authoritative.
** another referring to <https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoQA1[demoQA1]>, which is an instance of dqv:UserQualityFeedback containing a user feedback on the quality of the dataset. It also refers to a predefined quality dimension, <https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-dimension#completeness[]> ("completeness"), which is one of the categories in the controlled vocabulary of https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-dimension[Quality (sub)dimension].

* It has several quality measurements, <https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoQA1[demoQM1]>, ..., <https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoQM17[demoQM17]>: 
** Each  quality measurement refers to a predefined instance of dqv:Metric indicating the quality metric that particular measurement is a measurement of. For example, <demoQM1> is a measurement of the predefined quality metric <https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-metric#qm-completeness-1001[]> (wether or not there are missing objects in the dataset); <https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoQM2[demoQM2]> is a measurement of the predefined quality metric <https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-metric#qm-completeness-1002[]> (number of missing object); <https://w3id.org/demo-resources/demo-data-quality-assessments#demoQM3[demoQM3]> is a measurement of the predefined quality metric <https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-metric#qm-completeness-1003[]> (rate of missing object) etc. 


 
== Some cross-references with other demo resources [[cross-references]]

*_Note_*: _Not all possible cross-references are demonstrated in this showroom. The lists are thus not exhaustive._

*Dataset quality descriptions and classifications*, for example: 

* In order to have common understanding of the quality (sub)dimensions and quality metrics, there are a set of predefined quality (sub)dimensions published in the controlled vocabulary https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-dimension[Quality (sub)dimension], and a set of predefined quality metrics published in the controlled vocabulary https://data.norge.no/vocabulary/quality-metric[Quality metric]. 
* Quality descriptions may therefore refer to the predefined common categories of quality (sub)demensions and quality metrics, as explained above. 

*Dataset quality descriptions and concepts*, for example: 

* the predefined quality (sub)dimensions and the predefined quality metrics that quality descriptions refer to, are concepts. 

*Dataset quality descriptions and datasets*, for example: 

* Dataset quality descriptions are about the quality of datasets and referred to from descriptions of datasets.
